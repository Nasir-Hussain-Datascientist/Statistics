## Introduction to the p-value

- The **p-value** is a key concept in hypothesis testing, used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis.
- In this presentation, we will:
  - Define the p-value and explain its significance.
  - Explore a real-world example using a dataset of real estate prices.
  - Perform hypothesis testing to determine if waterfront properties have higher prices than non-waterfront properties.
- Tools and visualizations will include:
  - Statistical testing in R.
  - Interactive and static plots with `plotly` and `ggplot2`.
